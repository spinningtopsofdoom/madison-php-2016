# Property based test everything

!SLIDE

#Large costs
- Properties take longer to think of and make test for
- Generator of inputs is needed
- Tests are fairly removed from how code is used
- Tests take longer to run

!SLIDE

# Great Power to weight ratio
## Unit tests grow linearly with code size
## Catch many more errors per lines of code then unit tests

!SLIDE

# Less effected by code change
## Much less marginal cost per change and easier to extend

!SLIDE

# Better mental model
## Explicit properties vs inferring from unit tests

!SLIDE

# Generators
## Force thinking about your domain
## Incredibly composable

!SLIDE

# Example based tests uses
- Fast failure
- Show example code usage
- Documenting edge cases
