# Property based test everything

!SLIDE

#Large costs
- Properties take longer to think of and make test for
- Generator of inputs is needed
- Tests are fairly removed from how code is used
- Tests take longer to run

!SLIDE

#Makes testing more of a science
- Testing deep properties instead of surface features
- Running hundreds or thousands of experiments
- Inputs are randomly generated

# Example based tests uses
- Fast failure
- Show example code usage
- Documenting edge cases
